Regarding the application, I'd like to note that while it generally operates smoothly, there are specific features facing challenges, particularly in the database. When logging in or establishing a new account, it's essential to choose the user type. Regrettably, some buttons on the internal pages are presently unresponsive. Should anything freeze on the page, it's attributed solely to a database glitch in its corresponding tableâ€”simply refresh, and all should resume seamlessly. Appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
